      <h3> About Me </h3>
      <p> After graduating with a Bachelors of Science, I went into the medical profession. Through healthcare, I was able to solve a myriad of problems by thinking critically and defining needs. </p>

      <p> Throughout my time in healthcare, I realized I had an act for putting together websites for bloggers. I followed this road and it led to <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/" target = "_blank"> Thinkful</a>- I couldn't be happier!</p>

      <p> If you're looking to hire a newly devoted developer (or need a partner for a future hackathon) please send a message! I'm looking forward to working alongside other great developers. </p>
